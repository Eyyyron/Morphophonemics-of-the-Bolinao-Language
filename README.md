## Overview

This repository and accompanying ebook present a unified research and engineering effort to formalize the **morphophonemics of the Bolinao language** into an operational, programmable system. The project translates established linguistic theory into **working Python implementations**, forming a prototype *linguistic engine* that can analyze, reverse, and generate morphophonemic processes in Bolinao.

The work addresses a critical gap in the AI ecosystem: while high-resource languages rapidly gain computational tools, many indigenous languages remain digitally invisible. This project demonstrates that meaningful language technology begins not with surface-level digitization, but with deep structural modeling.

## Motivation

Artificial intelligence is advancing exponentially for high-resource languages like English and Spanish, while thousands of underrepresented languages risk exclusion—and eventual extinction—due to the absence of digital infrastructure.

Bolinao, like many Philippine languages, lacks computational grammar models that allow machines to understand how words *change*, not just how they are spelled. This project was created to address that gap by:

* Encoding morphophonemic rules as executable logic
* Demonstrating reversibility (surface → underlying forms)
* Enabling forward generation (underlying → surface forms)
* Preserving linguistic and cultural knowledge through computation

This work builds on the foundational linguistic research of **Gary C. Persons (1980)** and extends it into a computational domain.

---

## What This Project Is

* **An ebook** documenting the theory, rules, experiments, and cultural insights
* **A codebase** implementing those rules in Python
* **A proof-of-concept linguistic engine** for low-resource language technology
* **A cultural analysis** revealing environmental knowledge encoded in language

## Ebook Structure

The ebook is divided into three conceptual sections:

### I. Core Morphophonemic Mechanics (Chapters 1–7)

These chapters formalize the structural logic of Bolinao morphophonemics and encode them as deterministic rules:

* Assimilation
* Dissimilation
* Vowel Reduction
* Pronoun Shifts
* Mass and Number Indication
* Gemination
* Interaction of multiple processes

Each chapter includes:

* Linguistic rule decoding
* Reverse (undo) algorithms
* Forward (generative) algorithms
* Python implementations
* Quantitative results

### II. Validation and Cross-Lingual Analysis (Chapters 8–9)

These chapters evaluate the robustness of the system through:

* Cross-lingual comparison with Botolan Sambal
* Cognate similarity scoring
* Lexical convergence metrics

### III. Semantic and Cultural Analysis (Chapter 10)

The final chapter moves beyond mechanics into meaning, analyzing:

* Semantic domains
* Environmental encoding (maritime vs. agricultural vocabulary)
* Cultural density in closed lexical classes

This section demonstrates that Bolinao is not merely a grammatical system, but a map of lived experience.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Rule Transparency**
   All transformations are explicitly rule-based—no black-box models.

2. **Reversibility**
   Wherever possible, surface forms can be traced back to underlying forms.

3. **Lexicon-Grounded Validation**
   Generated candidates are checked against attested lexical data.

4. **Cultural Integrity**
   Linguistic computation is treated as cultural preservation, not abstraction.

---

## Who This Is For

* Linguists working on Austronesian or low-resource languages
* Developers building NLP tools for indigenous languages
* Researchers interested in rule-based morphology
* Cultural advocates exploring digital preservation
* Students seeking an applied example of computational linguistics

## Closing Note

This book and repository are offered as a statement of possibility: that technology, when grounded in linguistic heritage, can become a powerful tool for cultural survival.

Languages do not disappear because they are inadequate—but because they are ignored. This project refuses to ignore Bolinao.

*Time is precious. This work represents our best effort to preserve structure, meaning, and identity—before silence becomes permanent.*
